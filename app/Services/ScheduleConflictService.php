/**
 * All Section / Faculty / Room / Time-overlap conflict-detection logic
 * for the scheduling workspace lives here — controllers never run their
 * own conflict queries.
 *
 * SCOPE: THE SECTION BEING EDITED'S OWN TERM, NOT THE GLOBAL ACTIVE TERM
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every check in this service is scoped to every Section that shares
 * the SAME Academic Year + Semester as the Section currently being
 * edited/scheduled — via scopedSectionIds()/sectionTermSectionIds()
 * (Section::academic_year + Section::semester), NOT the single
 * institution-wide "Active Academic Term" pill shown in the topbar.
 *
 * This distinction matters: the Active Academic Term is a global
 * setting (only ever one at a time — see AcademicTerm::active()) used
 * for things like which term new records default to. But a
 * Registrar/Dean can, and routinely does, plan a FUTURE term's
 * schedule (e.g. 2nd Semester) while the CURRENT term (1st Semester)
 * is still the one marked Active. If conflict checks stayed scoped to
 * the Active Term, planning that 2nd-Semester section would compare
 * it against 1st-Semester bookings (irrelevant noise) while silently
 * missing real double-bookings against OTHER 2nd-Semester sections
 * sharing the same Room/Faculty — a false negative that would let two
 * 2nd-Semester sections get scheduled into the same Room at the same
 * time undetected. Scoping to the edited Section's own term instead
 * means a Faculty member, Room, or Section can never end up
 * double-booked within the semester actually being planned, no matter
 * which term happens to be globally Active at the time. Placements
 * belonging to a genuinely different semester are intentionally
 * ignored — they cannot conflict with a schedule being built for a
 * different one.
 *
 * Two schedules are considered overlapping when they share at least one
 * Day AND:
 *
 *     new_start < existing_end  AND  new_end > existing_start
 *
 * This single rule is applied identically for Section, Faculty, and
 * Room conflicts (see overlaps()) so the three checks can never drift
 * out of sync with each other.
 *
 * VALIDATION PRIORITY
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * validate() runs every check in this fixed order, per the Registrar's
 * spec, and returns as soon as a higher-priority check fails so the
 * Registrar / Auto Generate engine always sees the single most
 * important reason first:
 *
 *   1. Faculty availability      (Faculty exists & is Active)
 *   2. Faculty schedule conflict (this Section's own term)
 *   2b. Faculty daily-hours cap (this Section's own term) — separate
 *       from the weekly/semester Max Teaching Load: caps how many
 *       hours a Faculty member can be scheduled on ONE calendar day,
 *       regardless of how far under their weekly load they are. See
 *       findFacultyDailyHoursViolation() and the
 *       'workload.max_daily_teaching_hours' setting.
 *   3. Room availability         (Room exists & is Active)
 *   4. Room conflict             (this Section's own term)
 *   5. Section conflict          (this Section's own term)
 *   6. Lunch break restriction
 *   7. Academic calendar allowed days
 *   8. Time within allowed class hours
 *   9. Subject duration fits the slot
 *
 * Only when every one of these passes does a placement qualify for a
 * 100% confidence score (see RecommendationService).
 *
 * This service is deliberately framework-thin (one Eloquent query per
 * check, no HTTP concerns) so the future Genetic Algorithm scheduler
 * can call validate() on every candidate placement before finalizing a
 * generated schedule, exactly the same way the manual workspace does.
