/**
 * MEETING PATTERN INTELLIGENCE.
 *
 * Decides HOW MANY times a week a Subject should meet, and WHICH Day
 * combinations are acceptable, before RecommendationService::recommendTimes()
 * ever starts hunting for an open Start/End Time.
 *
 * This replaces the old hardcoded "always try Mon-Wed-Fri, then
 * Tue-Thu, then Mon-Wed..." list that used to live directly on
 * RecommendationService. That list mixed 3-meeting and 2-meeting
 * patterns together with no regard for what kind of Subject it was,
 * which is why the Auto Generate engine kept producing MWF lectures.
 *
 * Rules (per the Registrar's spec):
 *   - Lecture subjects        -> 2 meetings/week (Mon&Wed or Tue&Thu preferred)
 *   - Laboratory subjects     -> 1 meeting/week, one continuous block
 *   - Special subjects        -> 1 meeting/week (NSTP, PE, OJT, Thesis,
 *                                 Capstone, Practicum, Seminar, ...)
 *   - 3-meetings/week (MWF, TThS, ...) is NEVER generated unless a
 *     future administrator-facing config explicitly raises the cap.
 *
 * Everything here is config-driven (config/scheduling.php) so a future
 * "3 meetings/week" toggle, or per-college/per-subject overrides, can
 * be added without touching RecommendationService or AutoScheduleService
 * at all — they only ever ask this service "how many meetings, which
 * Day combos", never encode day-pattern logic themselves.
