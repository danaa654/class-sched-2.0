/**
 * "⚡ Auto Generate Schedule" (Prompt 8.9).
 *
 * This is NOT a blind auto-scheduler — it is a bulk driver on top of
 * RecommendationService/ScheduleConflictService, the exact same engine
 * the per-row "Recommend" drawer already uses. For every currently
 * UNSCHEDULED SectionSubject in a Section it asks the Recommendation
 * Engine for ranked Faculty, ranked Rooms, and a conflict-free Time
 * slot, then walks the top candidates until it finds a combination
 * that is fully conflict-free (Faculty, Room, Section, Duplicate,
 * Load, Capacity) — never inventing an assignment the recommendation
 * engine itself wouldn't have suggested one row at a time.
 *
 * Each accepted assignment is written to the row immediately (flagged
 * is_auto_generated = true, Status stays 'Draft') rather than held in
 * memory. This is deliberate: it lets every later subject in the same
 * run reuse ScheduleConflictService/RecommendationService completely
 * unmodified — an already-generated row is, from the engine's point
 * of view, indistinguishable from a manually-saved one, so "Smart
 * Search" (try the next faculty / next room / next day) falls out of
 * the existing ranking + conflict-skip logic for free instead of a
 * second, parallel implementation of it here.
 *
 * Nothing here ever touches a row that already has a Faculty, Room,
 * Days, Start Time, or End Time — manually assigned rows are always
 * left completely alone unless the Registrar explicitly clears/
 * regenerates.
