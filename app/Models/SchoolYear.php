 *   - Time Interval — the increment (in minutes) the engine slices
 *     the day into when searching for candidate start times.
 *   - Available Class Days — which days of the week the engine is
 *     allowed to generate schedules on.
 *   - Lunch Break (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM) — always enforced, never
 *     editable. `lunch_start`/`lunch_end` columns exist for the
 *     record, but the scheduling engine always uses the fixed
 *     LUNCH_BREAK_START/END constants below, never the column values.
 *
 * These settings apply to the ACTIVE School Year only — see active().
 * RecommendationService/MeetingPatternService pull from here (falling
 * back to sensible defaults if no School Year is Active yet) so
 * nothing in the scheduling engine hardcodes these values.
