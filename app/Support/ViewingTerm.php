 * a different (non-Active) Academic Term were current, WITHOUT
 * touching that term's real `status` column or affecting any other
 * user's session.
 *
 * Only Administrator/Registrar may set this override (see
 * AccessScope::isUnrestricted()) — every other role always resolves
 * straight to the real Active term, same as before this feature
 * existed. This is intentionally a SESSION value, not a users-table
 * column: it's a "what am I looking at right now" browsing
 * preference, not a durable account setting, so it naturally resets
 * to the real Active term on a fresh login/device.
 *
 * Every controller that used to call AcademicTerm::active() directly
 * for "what term should this page/report default to" should call
 * ViewingTerm::resolve($request) instead. The real Active term is
 * still the one true system-of-record status (enforced by
 * AcademicTerm::booted()) — this class never changes it.
