/**
 * FACULTY WORKLOAD VALIDATION SYSTEM.
 *
 * Single source of truth for "how loaded is this Faculty member right
 * now, and would assigning them one more Subject push them over their
 * Maximum Teaching Load". Every place in the scheduling engine that
 * needs a workload number or a workload decision — Auto Generate
 * Schedule, Recommend Faculty, Manual Assignment, Save Schedule, and
 * the Faculty Master's Workload tab/dashboard indicators — calls this
 * service rather than recomputing the sum itself, so the number the
 * Registrar sees in the recommendation panel, the Faculty profile, and
 * the "Teaching Load Limit Exceeded" warning can never quietly
 * disagree with each other.
 *
 * ACTIVE SEMESTER SCOPE
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Workload is always computed across every College/Department/Section/
 * Year Level, but ONLY for placements belonging to Sections in the
 * currently Active Academic Term (School Year + Semester) — see
 * ScheduleConflictService::activeSemesterSectionIds(), which this
 * service defers to so the two can never disagree about what "the
 * active semester" means. Inactive/past/future semesters never count
 * toward a Faculty member's current load.
 *
 * Counts both 'Scheduled' AND 'Draft' placements (never 'Conflict')
 * belonging to that faculty member — Draft is included deliberately:
 * Auto Generate Schedule writes each accepted assignment as Draft
 * before the Registrar clicks "Save Schedule", and later subjects in
 * the same run must still see that committed load, or the same
 * faculty member would keep winning "Lowest Teaching Load" for every
 * subject in the batch instead of load rotating across the department
 * as it actually grows.
 *
 * WORKLOAD MEASUREMENT
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Supports whichever measurement the institution has configured on
 * Faculty::workload_type — 'units' (Subject::units, the default) or
 * 'hours' (Subject::lecture_hours + Subject::laboratory_hours per
 * week, checked against Faculty::max_weekly_hours instead of
 * Faculty::max_teaching_units).
