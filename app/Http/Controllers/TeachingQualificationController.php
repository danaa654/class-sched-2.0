     * A full replace (sync) from the frontend's point of view, but per
     * spec Section 6/14, a scoped user must only ever be able to touch
     * the slice of qualifications within their own authorization:
     *   - Assistant Dean: GenEd/Minor qualifications only, any College.
     *   - Dean/OIC: Major qualifications only, for their own College's
     *     faculty. They must NEVER be able to add/remove a GenEd/Minor
     *     qualification just because the faculty belongs to their
     *     College (spec Section 14, explicit warning).
     *   - Admin/Registrar: everything (bypassed via Gate::before).
     *
     * We therefore compute the final subject set as: (existing
     * qualifications OUTSIDE the user's authorized category/scope,
     * left untouched) + (incoming ids that ARE within the user's
     * authorized category/scope). The request payload can never
     * smuggle in a change to qualifications the user isn't allowed
     * to touch, no matter what ids are submitted.
