/**
 * ACTIVITY LOG — the single place that writes to `activity_logs`.
 * Every controller/service that wants an entry in the Settings >
 * Activity Log tab calls ActivityLogService::record() (a thin
 * wrapper around a single ActivityLog::create()) — nothing else
 * should ever touch that table directly, same convention
 * NotificationService already enforces for `schedule_audit_logs`.
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT replace ScheduleAuditLog — field-level
 * scheduling diffs stay exactly where they are. Where a scheduling
 * action already routes through NotificationService (Section
 * created/finalized/unlocked, Subject added/removed, Faculty
 * deactivated/deleted directly), the call into here lives inside
 * NotificationService itself so both tables stay in sync from one
 * call site. Everywhere else (Settings changes, Faculty create/
 * update, Section update/delete, forced logout, password reset
 * requests) the owning controller/service calls record() directly.
