/**
 * INTELLIGENT IRREGULAR SECTION SCHEDULING.
 *
 * A Section marked Section Type = 'Irregular' does not get one
 * uniform block schedule the way a Regular section does — its
 * students take a mix of subjects that doesn't line up with any
 * single Regular section's curriculum year. So instead of asking
 * "where does this whole Section meet", Auto Generate Schedule asks
 * this service ONE SUBJECT AT A TIME: "is there already a Regular
 * section's class in session for this exact Subject that this
 * Irregular section's students could simply sit in on, or does this
 * need its own independent class?"
 *
 * This is the single source of truth AutoScheduleService defers to
 * for every Irregular-section placement, so the recommendation shown
 * in the Auto Generate review panel, the "Merge Recommendation" modal,
 * and whatever actually gets written to the row can never disagree.
 *
 * COMPATIBILITY CRITERIA (a candidate Regular section's class must
 * satisfy every one of these to even be considered — see
 * findCandidates()):
 *
 *   1. Same Subject (subject_id match on the candidate's own
 *      SectionSubject row).
 *   2. Same Curriculum, or an "equivalent curriculum mapping" —
 *      curriculum_id matches exactly, OR the two curriculums belong
 *      to the same Major (an older/newer curriculum version under the
 *      same program is treated as equivalent for merge purposes,
 *      since Irregular students very often carry a prior catalog
 *      year's curriculum_id while retaking/advancing alongside a
 *      Regular section on the current one).
 *   3. Same Major/Program (major_id match — implied by #2, checked
 *      explicitly too so the rule reads clearly on its own).
 *   4. Same Academic Year + Semester (both sections must belong to
 *      the currently Active Academic Term — see
 *      ScheduleConflictService::activeSemesterSectionIds()).
 *   5. The candidate class must already have a real schedule slot
 *      (Faculty, Room, Days, Start/End Time all filled in, status
 *      Scheduled or Draft) — merging rides along on an EXISTING
 *      class session, it never invents one.
 *   6. Room capacity remains sufficient after adding the Irregular
 *      section's estimated_students on top of every student count
 *      already resting on that room slot (the host section's own
 *      estimated_students plus every other Irregular section already
 *      merged into it).
 *   7. No Faculty, Room, or Section conflict is introduced — trivially
 *      true for Faculty/Room since merging adds no new booking, but
 *      the Irregular section itself must not already have a different
 *      class in that exact Day/Time window (checked via
 *      ScheduleConflictService::findSectionConflict()).
 *   8. Faculty workload stays within the configured limit — merging
 *      adds ZERO additional teaching load (it's the same one class
 *      session, not a second one), so this can only ever help, never
 *      hurt, an already-valid candidate. Kept as an explicit check
 *      for defense in depth in case workload_type/limits change
 *      out from under an in-flight recommendation.
 *   9. Academic Calendar scheduling rules — already enforced when the
 *      host class was originally scheduled/validated, so a merge can
 *      never violate them; re-checking the DAYS token against the
 *      currently configured available class days is a cheap defensive
 *      re-verification rather than a new rule.
 *
 * SCORING (best match — see scoreCandidate()):
 *   Ranks every compatible candidate by, in order of weight:
 *     - Room capacity headroom AFTER the merge (prefer the tightest
 *       fit that still comfortably fits — fills existing sections
 *       efficiently instead of scattering a few Irregular students
 *       across many different rooms/sections).
 *     - Lowest scheduling impact (merging is always zero-impact vs.
 *       independent scheduling, so this mainly breaks ties between
 *       multiple otherwise-equal candidates by preferring the one
 *       with more remaining capacity buffer, reducing the odds a
 *       LATER merge into the same class gets rejected).
 *     - Faculty workload delta (always 0 for a merge; included so the
 *       score breakdown reads consistently against the "independent"
 *       alternative, which is NOT zero).
 *     - Timetable compatibility (always 100% for a merge — the
 *       Irregular section, by definition, has no existing schedule
 *       of its own yet to conflict with at Auto Generate time).
 *
 * When zero candidates satisfy every constraint, recommend() returns
 * an 'independent' recommendation with a human-readable explanation
 * of the specific constraint that eliminated every candidate (or "no
 * matching class exists yet" when there was nothing to evaluate at
 * all), and AutoScheduleService falls through to its normal
 * Faculty+Room+Time search for that subject exactly as it would for
 * a Regular section.
