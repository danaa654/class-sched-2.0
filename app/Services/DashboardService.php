/**
 * DASHBOARD DATA — single source of truth for every widget on the
 * Scheduling Control Center (see DashboardController).
 *
 * ROLE-BASED SCOPE
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every number this service returns is filtered through scopeFor():
 *
 *   - Administrator / Registrar -> institution-wide, every College.
 *   - Dean / OIC                -> only the user's own College
 *     (User::college_id), via Section -> Major -> Department ->
 *     College. A Dean/OIC with no College assigned sees nothing
 *     rather than silently falling back to "everything".
 *   - Assistant Dean            -> General Education subjects only
 *     (Subject::category === 'General Education'), which are shared
 *     across every Major/College rather than tied to one. This is
 *     scoped at the SectionSubject level, not the Section level,
 *     since GenEd subjects live inside Sections that otherwise
 *     belong to Majors the Assistant Dean has no visibility into.
 *     NOTE: the source spec also mentions "Minor subjects" — the
 *     Subject model currently only distinguishes 'Major' vs
 *     'General Education' (see subjects table), so that half of the
 *     scope isn't representable yet. Revisit if/when a Minor
 *     category is added.
 *   - Any other/no role         -> nothing (fail safe, not fail
 *     open).
 *
 * ACTIVE SEMESTER SCOPE
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every widget is additionally scoped to the currently Active
 * Academic Term, via ScheduleConflictService::activeSemesterSectionIds()
 * — the same method the scheduling workspace's conflict checks use,
 * so the Dashboard's numbers can never quietly disagree with what
 * the Registrar sees while actually building the schedule.
